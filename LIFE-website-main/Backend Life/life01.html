        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many fascinating things in this world is the incapability of humans to define the very concept of words themselves and understand their depth in their entirety. A vain though almost triumphant attempt to somehow visualize or articulate our thoughts, to make sense out of our strangest ideas and perceptions, to rid ourselves of those very ideas in the hopes of maybe finding someone who might understand or relate? Maybe because the very essence of feeling lies in words themselves. There is a word for almost every feeling. Being probably the second oldest inherited belongings from our ancestors, first being this planet and the universe, and having traveled all this way to reach us here in a form unaltered, preserved with the same essence and depth as they once possessed, or perhaps even more depth, because of the history they carry and the different times through which they have been through, words have produced a way for us to express what we feel inside the most hidden parts of our beings, if not physically but, through language.</p>
